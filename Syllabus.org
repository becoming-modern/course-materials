* Course Description
What does it mean to be modern? We use words like “modern,” “modernity,” and “modernism” to mark a fundamental boundary between our era and all that came before it (or lies outside of it); but most of us are hard-pressed to offer a solid account of what exactly this boundary is. The precise nature of the rupture between modernity and pre- or non-modernity is a vast topic, and this course will not attempt to answer it fully. Instead, we will investigate the question of modernity with a particular eye to the history of science and technology. We will focus on a few key developments which took place in or around the Nineteenth Century, but will also wander into the first decades of the Twentieth. The organization of the course is an implicit argument that certain phenomena, namely:

1. /a fundamental shift in the nature of daily experience;/
2. /an order-of-magnitude expansion of the power of the State/; and
3. /a tremendous growth in the enterprise of Western science and technological production/

were intimately related. Over the coming months we will investigate these themes using a wide variety of sources, from literary texts to scientific papers, from technical history to cultural theory. A particularly urgent goal of the course is to integrate new approaches to the history of science and technology with recent developments in cultural history. For the most part we will focus on European developments, but we will occasionally range our somewhat further, looking in particular at events in the United States and in the European, especially British and French, empires.

This course asks difficult questions and demands a substantial commitment from students; in return, it provides a fairly sophisticated set of tools for thinking about history.

* Course Format
This course is nominally a lecture class, but enrollment is low, the subject matter is complex, and there's a lot to talk about. We will take advantage of the cozy setting to pursue a mix of lectures and discussion. 

* Prerequisites
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: prerequisites
  :END:

Background in modern European history and some background or interest in the history of science are both highly desirable. The course includes a small amount of technical content, which students will be asked to at least puzzle their way through; it also includes some fairly sophisticated and theoretical secondary sources. 

Class Format:

History Department policy provides for two hours of class time at the third year (Tuesday/Thursday 4-5). In past years I've added extra hours to facilitate discussion. This is something we should discuss at the first class.  Though participation is a small part of your mark, attendance at discussions is nonetheless /strongly/ advised. We will be reading difficult texts, and lectures will not cover all the issues they raise. /Your active engagement with the course material is an essential part of the course./

* Course Requirements:
Your grade consists of the following components:

|   | Assignment       | Due Date | Weight |
|---+------------------+----------+--------|
| # | Midterm "Exam" 1 | <2019-10-03 Thu>  |     25 |
| # | Midterm "Exam" 2 | <2019-11-14 Thu>  |     25 |
| # | Paper Proposal   | <2019-11-19 Tue>  |     10 |
| # | Final Paper      | <2019-12-05 Thu>  |     30 |
| # | Participation    | n/a      |     10 |
|---+------------------+----------+--------|
|   |                  |          |    100 |
#+TBLFM: @>$>=vsum(@I..@II)
# #+TBLFM: $>=$>>(100/@>$4)::@>$>>=vsum(@I..@II)

The "*Exams*" are take-home assignments somewhere between an ordinary midterm and a short paper. Though untimed, they are intended to be written in a finite time period over the course of just a few days. Each exam will ask you to write approximately two short essays in response to the class readings.

The *Paper Assignment* asks you to explore one or more of the course texts on your own. Using the class bibliography as a starting point if you wish, you will write a medium-length paper (10-12pp) analyzing, interpreting, and contextualizing the primary text. A paper proposal is due several weeks before the paper itself.  

Extensions granted for medical reasons only. Late assignments will be deducted 3% per day, with the exception of the take-home exams, which /will be marked “0” if not handed in by 5:00 PM on the due date/. Please note: the paper proposal is /required/, and term papers will not be accepted if a proposal is not handed in.

* Course Texts

Most of our required readings are primary sources and will generally be made available online, but I will make heavy use of recommended readings in my lectures. You may profit from having your own copies of some of the following texts:
- Scott, J. C., /[[http://myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/login?url=http://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/utoronto/detail.action?docID=3420352][Seeing like a state: how certain schemes to improve the human condition have failed]]/. (New Haven: Yale University Press,  1998). 
- Berman, M., /All that is solid melts into air: the experience of modernity/. (New York: Viking Penguin,  1988).
- von Goethe, J. W., & Atkins, S., /[[http://myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/login?url=http://books.scholarsportal.info/uri/ebooks/ebooks3/proquest-up/2018-09-25/3/9781400851676][Faust v. 1 & 2, in Goethe's Collected Works]]/. (Princeton, N.J: Princeton University Press,  1994).

* Accessibility
The University provides academic accommodations for students[with disabilities in accordance with the terms of the Ontario Human[Rights Code. For information on services and resources, see
[[http://www.studentlife.utoronto.ca/as]]

* Academic Integrity

The University of Toronto treats cases of plagiarism very seriously. The
/[[http://www.governingcouncil.utoronto.ca/Assets/Governing+Council+Digital+Assets/Policies/PDF/ppjun011995.pdf][Code of Behaviour on Academic Matters]]/  outlines the behaviours that constitute academic dishonesty and the procedures for addressing academic offenses. If you have questions or concerns about what constitutes appropriate academic behaviour or research and citation methods, you should seek information from your instructor or other university resources. See http://www.artsci.utoronto.ca/osai/students.

* Outline
This outline is *a work of fiction*. We will begin with this template but almost certainly not cover all of these topics; where it seems appropriate, we may stop and read more about any of them, or skip topics you have no interest in. Expect things to change!
